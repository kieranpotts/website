- [Deventy](https://github.com/ianrose/deventy) by Ian Rose, which keeps page generation (with Eleventy) separate from script compilation (with WebPack) and CSS pre-processing (with Sass and/or PostCSS) separate 

- The official [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) from the Eleventy team
